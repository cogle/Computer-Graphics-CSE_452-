For this lab I simply followed the instructions. I clicked on fluid.exe, clicked open and located the 
ShellInterface.fl file within the cse452shell directory. From here I located where the main window is
instanciated. Double clicking this brought up a window where I could edit the Fl_Text_Buffer, from "Demo",
into "Christopher Ogle".
